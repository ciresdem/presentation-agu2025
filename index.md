## Abstract

For years, the Coastal Digital Elevation Team at the University of Colorado’s Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences (CIRES) has developed cutting-edge software tools for creating and validating seamless topographic and bathymetric digital elevation models (DEMs). CUDEM+IVERT are used to develop nested DEMs in an updatable, systematic framework constructed from a wide range of public datasets; generate rigorous uncertainty estimates of those DEMs; and independently and automatically validate DEM accuracy against ICESAT-2 satellite lidar data. Users of these DEMs include scientific researchers, hazard modelers (tsunamis, storm surges, floods), infrastructure planners (state, local, and federal), and private industries (insurance, infrastructure, etc). The team works closely alongside the Natural Hazards group at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI), providing critical digital infrastructure for coastal planning and disaster mitigation. In addition to academic research use, the CUDEM+IVERT packages support a wide use of applications within a modular and cross-disciplinary software workflow that support data acquisition, subsetting, filtering, and validating datasets.

The CUDEM+IVERT software is housed in two code repositories that work closely together: the Continuously Updated Digital Elevation Model (CUDEM) framework and the ICESat-2 Validation of Elevations Reporting Tool (IVERT). Both repositories have been open-source and publicly accessible since their inception and are used by partner organizations and agencies. Currently with new funding support, both software packages are transitioning to an open-source ecosystem (OSE) environment to engage broader users and developers to collaboratively enhance the suite of DEM tools. We invite all interested parties in the geoscience community (software users and developers) to join us in the transition of the CUDEM+IVERT software environments toward a community-based approach for future enhancements of these open-source software tools for DEM data assembly, generation, and validation.
